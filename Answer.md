1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram?

Ans. Here in Product table category_id is a foreign key of id from "Product_Category" wwhich uniquely defines the "Product_Category" table. Since category_id is referring to id in "Product_Category" so category_id field is also uniquley defining the table "Product".

2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

Ans. To ensure that aeach product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it what we do is that we are inserting the data in database we can set category_id to be in a required state.
Eg. required: [true, "category_id is required"] or we can auto-increment the  category_id value.
